Patent holder and thought leader in the application of distributed ledgers and verifiable credentials in enterprise domains.

Research Interests: I am currently pursuing a Doctorate at Clarement Graduate University. "Agentic Tech" (Check this out to get an idea what it is: [https://www.agency.website/](https://www.agency.website/)), the idea that users own their data, their choices and their cognitive consent. I am especially interested in the area of health data and how we can use technologies such as verifiable credential, decentralized web nodes and self sovereign identity to allow users to own their health data. Also interested in allied areas of cryptography such as threshold signatures, differential privacy and homomorphic encryption. I would love to collaborate with AI researchers in using Federated Learning for AI using user data from decentralized web nodes.
